When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When you're working on multiple machines, collaborating with someone else, or sharing the info in your repo.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because the remote changes could overwrite work that you're doing and haven't yet committed.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  - Forks are a special type of a clone of a repo that exists on on GitHub.
  - Clones are copies created of an entire repo, can be on local computer.
  - Branches are separate version of a repo that are created and can later be merged back with their unique changes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  If you're going to be working without internet access, you can still see the diff in local and origin/master
  when you last pulled from it.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
  You could have local copies of the same file, but with multiple people all working on it, you'd have to diff all versions,
  manually merging in changes from each to your own.
