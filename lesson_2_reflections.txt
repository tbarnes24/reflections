What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git records the current version of each file and links them together.  You need to do it so that
the existing version of each file is associated with every other file when a commit is executed.

Caroline's answer:

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working dir in that the former is an abstract psuedo directory where Git
can add things that are in the working dir.  So you can have files that are in the working dir, but not in the
staging area.

It allows you to pick and choose which things in a directory you want to add to a repository via a commit.
